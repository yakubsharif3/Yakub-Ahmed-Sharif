As Ericsson is responsible for the installation of CCN, all CPI written for installation, upgrade, migration, and verification is written for the following target groups. CPI covering these areas will also be read and to some extent used by the network operators.

he Network Element Description describes the different types of calls and events that are available to the subscriber, and what kind of signalling and events these call types trigger in the different network elements.
Primary Target Group: Network Planning Engineer, System Administrator, Network Administrator, and Solution Architect
Secondary Target Groups: Application Administrator, Subscriber Administrator and Customer Care, O&M Management, and Marketing

The request methods in CCN are Charging Interrogation Protocol (CIP/IP and CIP/SS7), Account Finder Protocol, Mobile Application Part (MAP)v3 and Capability Set 1+ (CS1+).

The termination methods in CCN are Ericsson Real Time Charging (ERTC), Capability Set 1 with Ericsson extension (CS1+), CAMEL Application Part (CAP)v1, CAPv2, CAPv3, Service Charging Application Protocol (SCAP), Service Charging Application Protocol version 2 (SCAPv2), Service Rating Application Protocol (SRAP) and Gy.

The transfer method is File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
DA= dedicated account

SCTP (SIGTRAN) 

for SS7 The front-end processes run on the traffic processors equipped with physical E1/T1 termination and the back-end processes can be run on dedicated traffic processors. 
CCN acts as a relay function between the MSC and the SDP.


Diameter Accounting and Authorization Control (DAAC)/SCAPv2, which is based on Diameter RFC.


Two different types of CIP are available: CIP/SS7 and CIP/IP.

It is possible to charge for calls originating outside Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN).

It is possible to charge for originating, terminating, and forwarding calls inside and outside HPLMN. When a circuit switch connection is to be established, a call has to be activated. After the validation in order to set up the call has been made, the MSC/Gateway MSC (GMSC) contacts CCN for the instructions to handle a call for the subscriber. CCN then contacts SDP, which verifies that the subscriber has enough money for the call and reserves the amount for the first time interval. CCN then sends instructions to MSC/GMSC for the call.
When the time threshold is reached, MSC/GMSC notifies CCN. If it is possible to allow a new charging limit, after checking that there is money on the subscriber's account, CCN specifies a new threshold and the call continues. When the account balance equals or goes below the account empty limit the call is rejected. The call could end because either one of the parties hangs up or the credit is not enough for the next credit reservation. In both cases the CCN generates CDRs.

When a subscriber wants to establish a circuit switch connection, the subscriber can send a USSD message to Home Location Register (HLR). The message is forwarded to SDP using Ericsson's application of MAP (EMAP). SDP uses CIP to notify CCN about the call setup request. CCN then contacts SDP, which verifies if the subscriber has enough money for the call. CCN then sends a request to setup the call to MSC using CS1+ signaling, see Section 3.3.3 Relay Online Charging of Voice, CS1+. The call continues as a CS1+ call.

Relay Online Charging of GPRS is part of the Charging System feature GPRS real-time charging based on CAMEL phase 3. The feature enables charging of Packet Data Protocol (PDP) contexts (data transfer) in real time. The feature is realized, from a network point of view, by implementing the control logic of the charging service in CCN. CCN manages the PDP context control over CAMEL Application Part (CAP) version 3 and interacts with the SDP over CIP for rating and credit check. With PDP context control it means that CCN instructs the SGSN on how to proceed at error situations or when the subscriber account runs out of money.

Relay Online Charging of Content allows the operator to do session-based charging of time, volume, specific units or specified price in real time. All of these types of charging are based on Service Charging Application Protocol (SCAP)
